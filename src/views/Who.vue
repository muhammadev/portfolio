        My name is Muhammad Tarek. I have teached myself to build "internet things" since I was 17 - well, I'm not that old I'm only 20 years old, so it's been 3 years overall! But, I really enjoy my work and I really love programming.

        Outside Programming, I enjoy watching movies and I can <strong>strongly</strong> recommend interesteller for you, <mark>if happened that you didn't watch it already!</mark>
